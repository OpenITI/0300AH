90#AUTH#COMMENT##: EI2: "Abu ’l-Abbās Aḥmad b. Abī Yaʿḳūb b. D̲j̲aʿfar b. Wahb b. Wāḍiḥ was born in Bag̲h̲dād in the 3rd/9th century. Trained as a member of the secretarial class, he went to Armenia as a young man and later served under the Ṭāhirids [q.v.] in K̲h̲urāsān. After the fall of the Ṭāhirids there in 259/872-3, he settled in Egypt, and died there in the early 4th/10th century, but apparently not before 292/905.": http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_7970
