90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: MAROUSSIA
90#VERS#COMMENT##: annotation completed. no major changes added. headers
            aligned and extra blank space removed. first headings removed as the
            line was part of the text and not part of the structure.
            NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): There was no link to PDF and the text was not
            collated with a printed version. I found the PDF and tagged the missing headers
            and corrected the levelling. 2- I added a few titles in square bracket based on
            the printed version. On the right-side bar of the link I provided for the PDF,
            there are other titles in square brackets that can be added to make the
            structure clearer. I just added the really necessary ones. 3- PARATEXT added. 4-
            The link to the PDF leads you to a payment-based website and you must have an
            account to see the PDF (which is the same edition as the digital version). Other
            editions of the text are also accessible: https://archive.org/details/yaqubi/1;
