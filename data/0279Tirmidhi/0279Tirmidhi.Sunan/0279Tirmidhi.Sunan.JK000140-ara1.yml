    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
    Link to the text file as it was before it was cleaned:
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenITI/1425AH/pre-clean/data/1420MuhammadNasirDinAlbani/1420MuhammadNasirDinAlbani.SahihWaDacifSunanTirmidhi/1420MuhammadNasirDinAlbani.SahihWaDacifSunanTirmidhi.JK000140-ara1
    PV formatted the structural annotation, which was quite good to start with.
    Page numbers in vol. 3 do not follow the PDF (second edition);
    perhaps they follow the pagination of the first edition?
    Pagination in vols. 4-5 is only on the ḥadīth level;
    the exact location of the page break is not indicated.
