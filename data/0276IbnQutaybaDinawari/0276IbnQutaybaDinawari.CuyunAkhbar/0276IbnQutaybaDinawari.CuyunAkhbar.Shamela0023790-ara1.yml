90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- I used a different edition for collation. However
            the titles are exactly the same. I checked many paragraphs. The
            difference was not more than a very few words. 2. The PARATEXTs at the
            end of some chapters are the notes of the scribe in addition to some
            added texts by the scribe.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
