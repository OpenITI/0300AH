90#VERS#COMMENT##: Originally tagged by Leonie, completed by Gowaart.
            Cleaned up annotation in general and changed all subheadings under
            aḥādīth which were labelled as biographies to second-level headers, as
            these are simply ḥadīth organised according to main transmitter, and not
            biographies.
           NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I untagged the second-level headers for hadiths as they have no headers, and are simple paragraphs (However I added an asterisk (# *) so that they are distinguishable from other paragraphs). From PageV02P450, I moved up all headers by one level (since they are the continuation of the tafsirs on prophetic hadiths). PARATEXT added.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
