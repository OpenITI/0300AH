90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Leonie Nückell; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Originally tagged by Leonie, completed by Gowaart.
    Cleaned up annotation in general and changed all subheadings under
    aḥādīth which were labelled as biographies to second-level headers, as
    these are simply ḥadīth organised according to main transmitter, and not
    biographies.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I untagged the second-level headers for hadiths as they have no headers, and are simple paragraphs (However I added an asterisk (# *) so that they are distinguishable from other paragraphs). From PageV02P450, I moved up all headers by one level (since they are the continuation of the tafsirs on prophetic hadiths). PARATEXT added.
