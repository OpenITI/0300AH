90#VERS#COMMENT##: From LN > text and pdf were quite tricky. everthing is tagged now but I'm not sure about chapters leveling and biographies. Needs to be reviewed; the same edition as in PDF; texts quality looks fine; duration > 3 hours; From GVDB > Annotated by Leonie, validated by Gowaart. Rather many corrections to improve structure. I have also cleaned up the text somewhat by deleting footnotes, which could be done easily with regex. Pagination has not been implemented successfully and instead follows its own system with "/pagenumber". This seems rather complex to fix, so I have not tried.
