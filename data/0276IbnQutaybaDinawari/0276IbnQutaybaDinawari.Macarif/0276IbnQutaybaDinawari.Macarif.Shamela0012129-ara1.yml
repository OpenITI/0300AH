90#VERS#COMMENT##: From LN > text and pdf were quite tricky. everthing
    is tagged now but I'm not sure about chapters leveling and biographies.
    Needs to be reviewed; the same edition as in PDF; texts quality looks
    fine; duration > 3 hours; From GVDB > Annotated by Leonie, validated by
    Gowaart. Rather many corrections to improve structure. I have also
    cleaned up the text somewhat by deleting footnotes, which could be done
    easily with regex. Pagination has not been implemented successfully and
    instead follows its own system with "/pagenumber". This seems rather
    complex to fix, so I have not tried.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Changes in the levelling of the headers made.
    Untagged headers tagged. A few untagged name entries tagged (there seems to be
    more untagged entries in the text. However, unfortunately, the entries are not
    numbered, and the only way to find the untagged ones is to collate the digital
    text with the PDF carefully). A title added in PageV01P117 in square brackets. A
    blank header added in PageV01P249. 2- Pagination of the text is correct. The
    numbers between // reported by Gowaart are not page numbers (maybe They are
    markers representing something in the manuscript. I have no idea). 3- The PDF is
    a reprint of the digital edition.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
