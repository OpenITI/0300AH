#META# Editorial declaration: LAL Arabic texts are based upon original manuscript research. For each text, a base manuscript is selected, and notable variants from other consulted manuscripts provided. Details of the manuscripts are provided in the source Desc; the first manuscript listed therein in the base. Arabic ḥarakāt other than shaddah are only provided for disambiguation of possible readings or for unusual words; however all shaddahs except those arising from the assimilation of the definite article are included. Orthography may be standardized to modern style.
#META# Editorial declaration: Texts are divided into numbered sections, which in the bilingual version are used to align the Arabic text with the English translation. The majority of manuscripts will not, of course, have been written with modern paragraph structures: the division of the text into such is for readability and to align with the translation, and is entirely the choice of the editor(s).
#META# Editorial declaration: There is only one known manuscript containing both Faḍl al-ʿArab and al-Tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā together, housed in Dār al-Kutub in Cairo. The text of Faḍl al-ʿArab was also preserved in a Damascus manuscript bearing the title Dhamm al-ḥasad, but it is no longer extant, and is only preserved in Kurd ʿAlī’s printed edition, discussed below. The manuscripts are both fragmentary: the Cairo one lacks the opening section of Faḍl al-ʿArab, while the Damascene apparently lacked al-Tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā entirely. Our edition is consequently a composite effort, relying principally on an electronic copy of the Cairo manuscript for Faḍl al-ʿArab and al-Tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā, and on Kurd ʿAlī’s edition for the opening pages of Faḍl al-ʿArab. Some sections from Faḍl al-ʿArab contained in the Cairo manuscript are illegible in the electronic copy we have had at our disposal, but it seems that Dr. Walīd Maḥmūd Khāliṣ, who published an edition of both Faḍl al-ʿArab and al-Tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā in 1998, was able to read these leaves. For these sections, our edition of Faḍl al-ʿArab is entirely reliant on Dr. Khāliṣ’s edition.
#META# Editorial declaration: Faḍl al-ʿArab was edited by James E. Montgomery. al-Tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā was edited Peter Webb. This was therefore very much a collaborative effort.
#META# Editorial declaration: The Cairo manuscript (Dār al-Kutub, catalog number 1864 Adab) contains sixty-nine folios and is cataloged under the title Lāmiyyat al-ʿArab, ascribed to the pre-Islamic poet al-Shanfarā. The manuscript’s first fourteen folios consist of poetry by al-Shanfarā, followed by Ibn Qutaybah’s Faḍl al-ʿArab wa-l-Tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā. The manuscript was written in Rabiʿ al-Thani 589 (April/May 1193) by Abū l-Futūḥ Hibat Allāh ibn Yūsuf ibn Khamartāsh al-Mukhtārī, a “secretary” (kātib), student of Hadith, and, according to the biographer al-Dhahabī, writer of “average poetry” who died in Jumada al-Thani 605 (December 1208/January 1209), probably in Baghdad. The manuscript is in naskhī script, with approximately sixteen lines per page; it has copious, though not always correct, vocalization, and many letters are written without consonantal diacritics, causing some challenges for interpretation. The manuscript contains a small number of corrections, some in the copyist’s hand, and a later hand has added a few short marginal notes. On the right-hand margin of the last folio (f. 69v) is a note in the copyist’s hand that reads qūbila wa-ṣuḥḥiḥa muʿāraḍatan bi-l-aṣl wa-li-llāh al-ḥamd wa-l-minnah (“read against and corrected from the original; praise God, our Benefactor”), indicating the manuscript was transcribed from a direct copy, or perhaps an autograph by Ibn Qutaybah.
#META# Editorial declaration: The manuscript is in poor condition: the ink has bled from the effects of humidity and the paper is marred with stains throughout, rendering some passages nearly illegible. Approximately the first half of the text that we present in our edition is missing in the Cairo manuscript, which begins on f. 15r with the phrase wa-qāla ākhar. In our edition this corresponds to §1.9.7 (Kurd ʿAlī, p. 366, line 5; Khāliṣ, p. 75, line 6). There appear to be some additional leaves missing between f. 15v and f. 16r: the last (legible) words of f. 15v are khurs fuṭs (§1.9.10; Kurd ʿAlī, p. 367, line 11; Khāliṣ, p. 78, line 3). The opening words of f. 16r, however, are wa-l-imāmah hiya al-taqaddum (§1.11.3; Kurd ʿAlī, p. 374, line 6; Khāliṣ, p. 91, line 6). A very rough calculation suggests that about four leaves have been lost. Damage to the manuscript is particularly acute from about line 13 of f. 17v, where the last discernible phrase we could make out is min sūʾ (§1.12.3; Kurd ʿAlī, p. 376, line 18; Khāliṣ, p. 96, line 2) to f. 23v, where the first legible phrase is anna rajulan (§1.13.3; Khāliṣ, p. 105, line 16). These five and a half leaves are virtually unreadable on our electronic copy of the manuscript, though a smattering of phrases can be made out here and there. Clearly Khāliṣ was able to read them when he worked on the manuscript, and so the corresponding paragraphs of the present edition are based entirely on his work. Readers interested in knowing how Khāliṣ restored many part of this section of the text from corresponding passages in Ibn Qutaybah’s works are referred to his edition.
#META# Editorial declaration: Throughout the manuscript, and especially toward the last paragraphs of Faḍl al-ʿArab, there are many damaged passages and illegible lines, but the transcription is generally of a good quality when it is legible. A comparison with the text of the Damascus manuscript preserved in Kurd ʿAlī’s edition suggests that the Cairo manuscript was copied from a different exemplar.
#META# Editorial declaration: The Cairo manuscript of Faḍl al-ʿArab contains a number of other marginal comments, one (on f. 18r) in the hand of the copyist and others (ff. 16v, 17v, 25v) in a different hand. The most significant, perhaps, is the comment on f. 15r: hādhā fī Faḍl al-ʿArab ʿalā l-ʿAjam li-bn Qutaybah. The extensive full-page marginalium on f. 16v is effectively illegible.
#META# Editorial declaration: As for al-Tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā, f. 31r bears the title “Part Two of On the Superiority of the Arabs over the Easterners,” and the text runs from f. 31v to f. 69v. The text on the upper parts of ff. 31–37 is partly obliterated. There also seems to be a tear between f. 37 and f. 38, which explains a break in the text: f. 37v ends with the introduction of a poem about clouds, whereas f. 38r begins with a section of prose. This suggests that an unknown number of folios may be missing. The prose appears to be part of an anecdote relating to medicine, discussed further below. Issues of legibility aside, the transcription is of good quality, though there are minor copyist errors in some of the poems and, particularly, in the prose section on wisdom aphorisms.
#META# Editorial declaration: The Cairo manuscript of al-Tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā is only lightly annotated: we identified nineteen notes attributable to perhaps as many as four different hands. Most marginalia are merely brief notations of corrections to miscopied words in the manuscript, though three offer some insight into the manuscript’s production and subsequent life.
#META# Editorial declaration: The frontispiece of al-Tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā, f. 31r, contains a full-page note of ownership, declaring the manuscript to be the property (mulk) of one Ibrāhīm ibn Yaḥyā, and the note traces his genealogy across a full twenty-eight generations to the fourth caliph, ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib, via his son al-Ḥasan. Although we have not found any other reference to this owner, the note indicates that he was a sayyid, a descendant of the Prophet Muḥammad, and that the passage of twenty-eight generations places him in about the fifteenth century.
#META# Editorial declaration: On f. 33v, the copyist notes that he changed a word from “the original” (al-aṣl), replacing the verb yashuddu with yaṣilu in an expression about a horse’s gallop. The change has no particular bearing on the expression’s meaning, but it indicates that the copyist was amenable to making corrections when producing his copy of al-Tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā, though, as was common practice, he expressly notes his changes. The same expression appears in Ibn Qutaybah’s ʿUyūn al-akhbār with the verb yaṣilu. The copyist’s correction thus (re)aligns the manuscript with Ibn Qutaybah’s original, perhaps indicating that the source of the Cairo manuscript was not an autograph; however, the absence of other such corrections and pertinent marginalia makes this difficult to determine.
#META# Editorial declaration: Folio 34v contains a remark in a later hand: fāʾida: innā kitāb adab al-kātib li-l-muʾallif Ibn Qutaybah. The note is written beside Ibn Qutaybah’s invitation to readers to consult his other book on horses (see §2.2.11 in our edition), indicating the later reader consulted the manuscript with awareness of Ibn Qutaybah’s wider oeuvre.
#META# Editorial declaration: The only lengthy marginal note in the manuscript is on f. 66v: mostly illegible, it appears to discuss the proper vocalization of certain words which we were not able to identify.
#META# Editorial declaration: Previous Editions
#META# Editorial declaration: Kitāb al-ʿArab aw al-radd ʿalā l-Shuʿūbiyyah. The Damascus manuscript was published by Jamāl al-Dīn al-Qāsimī l-Dimashqī (1866–1914) and was subsequently featured by Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī in the journal Al-Muqtabas in 1909; it was then republished in a popular anthology in 1946. Al-Qāsimī had found the manuscript within a multitext compilation belonging to the private library of Shākir al-Ḥamzāwī (d. 1910). The manuscript recorded Ibn Qutaybah as author, the book’s title as Kitāb Dhamm al-ḥasad, and its date of copying as the twelfth Hijri century (1688–1785), but was incomplete (ending at paragraph §1.12.5 of our edition). The Damascus manuscript has been missing since the time of Kurd ʿAlī.
#META# Editorial declaration: Faḍl al-ʿArab wa-l-tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā, edited by Walīd Maḥmūd Khāliṣ (Abu Dhabi: al-Majmaʿ al-Thaqāfī, 1998). This was the first time al-Tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā was published, and the first edition to use the Cairo manuscript. The edition is excellent, especially considering the manuscript’s damaged state. It has copious footnotes cross-referencing other classical Arabic texts that also contain the anecdotes and poems Ibn Qutaybah cites. Khāliṣ’s efforts greatly assisted us in the preparation of our edition. It would be no exaggeration to say that our edition of Faḍl al-ʿArab could not have been accomplished without his pioneering work and impressive erudition.
#META# Editorial declaration: The Arabic Text
#META# Editorial declaration: Faḍl al-ʿArab: Our edition is composite. Paragraphs §1.1.1 to §1.9.7 are based on Kurd ʿAlī’s edition of the Damascus manuscript; paragraphs §1.12.3 to §1.13.3 depend entirely upon the text reproduced by Khāliṣ; and in many instances we have relied on Khāliṣ’s restitution, through comprehensive detective work, of damaged passages. In general, the text of our edition appears somewhat incomplete. For example, the copyist (or more probably his exemplar) is often not interested in the isnāds of the hadiths quoted. In this respect it compares unfavorably with the Damascus manuscript, which does reproduce the isnāds ignored in the Cairo manuscript.
#META# Editorial declaration: For Faḍl al-ʿArab these principles have been followed:
#META# Editorial declaration: Priority is given to the text of the Cairo manuscript wherever possible and practicable; this means that on numerous occasions our edition does not reproduce Khāliṣ’s restorations but seeks to remain faithful to the manuscript; this also means that if we were able to conclude that the text of the manuscript made sense, however unorthodox it may seem from the point of view of accepted syntax or lexicon, then we have retained the manuscript reading.
#META# Editorial declaration: For the sections missing from the beginning of the treatise up to §1.9.7, priority is given in all but a few cases to Kurd ʿAlī’s edition of the Damascus manuscript.
#META# Editorial declaration: In the case of restored paragraphs, priority is given to parallel passages in Ibn Qutaybah’s own oeuvre, and when these were not available, to the texts closest to Ibn Qutaybah’s floruit. We have relied on the extensive annotation provided by Khāliṣ for these parallel citations and generally do not reproduce this documentation in our book. The reader interested in tracking down analogues and parallels should consult Khāliṣ’s edition.
#META# Editorial declaration: All of the minor lacunae in the Cairo manuscript have been signaled with ellipses in the text and/or recorded in the apparatus, as have discrepancies between the manuscript and the editions of Kurd ʿAlī and Khāliṣ. Given that we have been working from a badly damaged singleton, it seemed reasonable to rely on these editions as sources—often our only ones—in their own right. For the translation, we have employed italics to signal a conjectural reconstruction of the text and ellipses for lacunae whose meaning we could not reconstruct. For the longer of such lacunae, we include in our notes English translations of the corresponding Arabic words and phrases.
#META# Editorial declaration: The meter of the verses is identified.
#META# Editorial declaration: al-Tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā: Several improvements to Khāliṣ’s edition were possible by consulting the manuscript afresh, including making out some words that were obscure to him, and correcting a small number of misreadings. Khāliṣ’s amendments based on his extensive cross-referencing were very faithful, though in several cases the parallel texts did not match exactly. In preparing this edition, we consulted works by Ibn Qutaybah, but wherever possible our Arabic retains the manuscript’s wording even where it is partially defective. The urge to “improve” the text was generally resisted in order to present the Arabic “as is”; all the minor corrections we deemed necessary are explained in the English notes.
#META# Editorial declaration: For al-Tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā these principles have been followed:
#META# Editorial declaration: Lacunae in the manuscript were filled where a parallel text by Ibn Qutaybah could be identified. The lacunose original is recorded in the footnotes with ellipses, and, unless otherwise indicated, all such completions are drawn from Khāliṣ; we are much indebted to his sterling efforts in locating the cross-references.
#META# Editorial declaration: Where a defective passage could not be identified elsewhere, lacunae are marked in the text with ellipses.
#META# Editorial declaration: To lighten the apparatus criticus, cross-references to citations of anecdotes and poetry in other classical Arabic texts are omitted. Readers are directed to Khāliṣ’s annotation.
#META# Editorial declaration: Where the Arabic text as recorded in the manuscript is so defective as to corrupt the meaning, the Arabic is corrected, with a note indicating the manuscript’s original text. The source for each correction is noted in the endnotes to the translation.
#META# Editorial declaration: Errors in vocalization in the manuscript have not been corrected; we vowel prose only when essential; and poems are fully vocalized.
#META# Editorial declaration: We added the meter of each poem in square brackets before the first line.
#META# Editorial declaration: The few marginal annotations and corrections in the manuscript are not recorded in our apparatus (but are discussed above).

~~إنا خلقناكم من ذكر وأنثى وجعلناكم شعوبا وقبائل لتعارفوا إن أكرمكم عند
~~الله أتقاكم} وقال الشعوب من العجم والقبائل من العرب وقد قدم الله الشعوب
~~في الذكر والمقدم أفضل من المؤخر.
# [1.14.2]
# وكنت أرى أهل التسوية يحتجون بهذه الآية ولم أعلم أن أحدا يعقل يدعي
~~الفضل بها ولا يرضى بالمحاجزة. وقد غلط من وجهين أحدهما أن تقديم الذكر لا
~~يوجب تقديم الفضل قال الله عز وجل @QUR@04 {يا معشر الجن والإنس} فقدم الجن
~~على الإنس والإنس أفضل منها وقال لا يعزب عنه @QUR@07 {مثقال ذرة في الأرض
~~ولا في السماء} فقدم الأرض والسماء أفضل منها وهذا يكثر لو تتبعناه. والوجه
~~الآخر أن العجم ليست بالشعب أولى من العرب وكل قوم كثروا وانشعبوا فقد
~~صاروا شعوبا حكى ابن الكلبي عن أبيه أن الشعب أكثر من القبيلة ثم العمارة
~~ثم البطن ثم الفخذ ثم العشيرة ثم الفصيلة ... فلم أر سعدا مثل وقال ...
~~خليطين من شعبين ... جميعا وكانا بالتفرق ... وإنما نسبت العجم إلى الشعوب
~~لأن ما انشعب منها أكثر مما انشعب من العرب فجعلت الشعوب علما لأجناسها.
# [1.14.3]
# وأما أهل التسوية فإن منهم قوما غلبت عليهم السلامة ومالت بهم الديانة
~~فذهبوا إلى قول الله عز وجل @QUR@05 {إن أكرمكم عند الله أتقاكم} وإلى قول
~~النبي صلى الله عليه إن الله قد أذهب عنكم عبية الجاهلية وفخرها بالآباء
~~مؤمن تقي وفاجر شقي وإلى قوله كلكم بني آدم طف الصاع لم تملأ وليس لأحد على
~~أحد فضل إلا بالتقوى وإلى قوله الناس سواء كأسنان المشط وتجدون الناس كإبل

~~ولم يكن يعرفه وإنما أراد بالشرف أعلاه وبالبيت بيته الذي يأوي إليه
~~وبالقدم قدمه التي يمشي عليها. وكذلك قيل أيضا رؤساء وقيل للأدنياء السفلة

# [1.14.7]

~~والتأخير بها وكانوا يأخذون دية القتيل على قدر أسرته فربما ودوا الواحد

~~فأعلمهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه أنه لا فضل لأحد على أحد في أحكام الدين

# [1.14.10]
# وقد يكون الرجل كثير الذنوب كثير الخطأ فيغفر ذلك من أجل يساره وكذلك قيل
~~الغنى رب غفور وشبيه بهذا قوله مروءة الرجل خلقه لأن المروءة اجتناب
~~القبائح والسيئات. وقال معاوية لعمرو بن العاص ما ألذ الأشياء؟ قال عمرو مر
~~أحداث قريش أن يقوموا فلما قاموا قال إسقاط المروءة ... واتبع الهوى فركب

~~ويدفعون عن الذكر القبيح وقد يكون سيء الأخلاق فيتجنون عليه الذنوب ويخرصون
