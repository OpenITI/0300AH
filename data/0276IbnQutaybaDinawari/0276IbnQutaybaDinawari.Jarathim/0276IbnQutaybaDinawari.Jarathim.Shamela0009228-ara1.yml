90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Annotated by unknown annotator, validated by Gowaart.
    Original annotation had less hierarchical subdivision of headers, text
    now has three levels of headers. Some of this has been decided on the
    basis of content rather than on the edition's layout which is somewhat
    haphazard.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I made major changes in the levelling of the headers. However, since the annotator has tagged the text “on the basis of content”, I kept his work as a separate file with completed extension, and saved my file with mARkdown extension. It’s possible that the annotator’s tagging is more accurate than mine since I didn’t read the text and my levelling is just based on what I can infer from the titles. A specialist can decide about this by reading the whole text closely.
