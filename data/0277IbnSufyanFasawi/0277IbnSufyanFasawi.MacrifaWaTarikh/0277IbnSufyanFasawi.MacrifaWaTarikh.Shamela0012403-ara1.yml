90#VERS#COMMENT##: The METADATA section is not in its normal shape.
    2-The edition I used for annotation is a reprint of the digital edition
    published by a different publisher; but in the appendixes attached to
    the end of the third volume, the editor has added some newly-founded
    parts to the text that do not exist in the digital text. From
    PageV01P423 onwards, it is better to tag the names as titles rather than
    biographical entries (some other titles appear inside the text and
    besides, some of the names are more similar to titles than biographical
    entries). 3- There are a lot of names in the third volume, but they are
    not part of the structure of the book since they don’t have any number
    or any other sign which separate them. So, they could not be tagged
    (structurally). 4- In Vol 3, we know that Yazid passed away in 64 AH.
    So, the rest of the years could not be categorized under his reign.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
