90#VERS#COMMENT##: The structure of the book is very arbitrary. The author categorizes the names of the people who have quoted the words of the prophet in alphabetical order; but after naming someone from a specific tribe, he suddenly digresses to name other persons from that tribe and then returns to the alphabetical order. I categorized these digressions as sub-headers (mostly fifth-level header) and showed the return to the alphabetical order by a blank header tag (so that they are distinguishable). Moreover, the author names irrelevant names inside a category that is supposed to belong to one specific name (for example, the author mentions names like “أنسة”, “وإبراهيم”, … under the category entitled “من روى عن النبي اسمه: أوس” (in page 75-76)) . I also separated these names by a blank header so that they are distinguishable from the main category. Besides, sometimes the author names someone out of alphabetical order to add some explanation about him. I tagged such names with an asterisk (i.e. ### $ *). The last part of the text categorized some people according to brotherhood. I tagged these names with an asterisk too (see my note on “السفر الثالث” about this kind of names).
