90#VERS#COMMENT##: ATTENTION: This book needs a review by a specialist
    in Hadith literature. It is very difficult for tagging since the
    structure is complex without enough and coherent titles. I try to
    explain all issues here: 1- From page PageV01P085 to PageV01P139 the
    text is categorized according to brotherhood and this relationship
    appears in one of three formats: “ولد مزاحم” or “محمد بن مزاحم، والضحاك
    بن مزاحم أخوان” or “محمد بن مزاحم أخو الضحاك بن مزاحم”. I tagged the
    first format as a header (since it is a title about a family) and the
    second and the third formats as biographical tag. But I tagged the names
    in the second format with an asterisk (i.e. ### $ *) to make it
    distinguishable from the other format (so that you can delete or change
    them if necessary, since this format includes more than one name
    anyway). Moreover, in other parts apart from the aforementioned part,
    sometimes the author names someone out of the category being discussed
    to add some explanation about him. I also tagged such names with an
    asterisk so that they are distinguishable from the other names. 2- From
    PageV01P158 to PageV01P181 and from PageV01P360 to PageV02P042, some
    titles are just related to one or a few paragraphs. This happens because
    most of the titles are interred into the text from the margin of the
    manuscript as the editor mentions. Although some events are separated by
    the title “وفي هذه السنة” (and I have tagged the text exactly according
    to the titles in the PDF), but I must warn that this title is not only
    vague, but also occasional and just appears in the beginning of some
    events (and not all of them). So, one solution could be deleting all the
    second-level tags (since they don’t encompass all the following
    paragraphs). There is a table of contents in Vol 4 which is descriptive
    (i.e. a description of the contents of paragraphs) and cannot be used
    for tagging the text; but, the other solution could be adding extra
    titles using this descriptive table of contents to make the structure of
    the book more accurate (And the last solution is to accept the text as
    it is and doing nothing!). The decision must be taken by a specialist in
    Hadith literature. 3- In PageV01P156 the text need a title: “اوّل من
    آمن:” (as written in the descriptive table of contents). 4- As written
    in page V02P109, a part is missing in the original manuscript. So, the
    rest of the text is not about the same person (i.e. “سعيد بن جبير”). I
    guess that it must be about “سعيد بن المسيب”. 5- In Vol 3, after naming
    an important person, the author names those he has quoted from and those
    who have quoted from him and then returns to the rest of the names of
    the main category and does the same thing for another important person.
    I showed the return to the main category by a blank header to make the
    next names distinguishable from the previous ones.
