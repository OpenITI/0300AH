90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH, PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Only two parts (al-sifr al-thānī and al-sifr al-thālith)
    of this book are extant, each in a separate manuscript
    and with a different riwāya (see intro to sifr 1, p. 13).
    They were originally in separate text files
    (Shamela0001440 (sifr 2) and Shamela0008477 (sifr 3)).
    PV joined them together into a single file.
    The original text files only contained PageV00P000 page numbers;
    HRH and PV marked page numbers for the beginning of each volume and some
    important sections
    (PageV2xPxxx for al-sifr al-thānī, and PageV3xPxxx for al-sifr al-thālith)
    The folio numbers in the manuscripts were indicated
    between square brackets: e.g., `[ق/1/أ]` (folio 1, recto).
    PV added mARkdown-style folio numbers: FolioVxxPxxxA (A for recto, B for verso)
    Manuscripts used by the editors:
    * al-sifr al-thānī: one manuscript: in al-Khizāna al-ʿāmma (Rabat, Morocco):
    FolioV21Pxxx
    * al-sifr al-thālith: two manuscripts:
    - in Khizānat al-Qarāwiyyīn (Fes, Morocco): contains ajzāʾ 5-9 (the latter only
    partially): FolioV31Pxxx
    - in al-Maktaba al-Maḥmūdiyya (Medina): contains parts of ajzāʾ 49 and 50:
    FolioV32Pxxx
    The editor of al-sifr al-thānī notes that one page is probably missing from the
    start
    of the manuscript (intro, p. 13-14; PV indicated this in the text using
    `[...]`);
    the editor also moved the misplaced pages [ق/131/أ-ب] to their proper place
    (after [ق/111/ب]).
    For other anomalies in the page numbering, see intro p. 14-15.
    The editor added some titles between square brackets that were not in the
    manuscript.
    The manuscript is divided into ajzāʾ; the editor considers these not to be
    part of the original plan of Ibn Abī Khaythama, so they are marked here as
    paratext. PV added a tag `###JUZx###` at the beginning of each juzʾ.
    Note by the vetter (PV): I ironed out some inconsistencies in the
    numbering of the paragraphs and section headers; fixed an issue
    with missing last characters before the end of pages; and made
    slight tweaks to HRH's excellent header tags.
    The central section of the first part of al-sifr al-thānī is a list of "aṣḥāb"
    of the Prophet;
    this list is mostly organized alphabetically, on the ism of the ṣāḥib.
    Often used names are grouped under a subheading.
    Whenever a ṣāḥib from an important tribal group is mentioned
    (or the ism is the name of a tribal group),
    other aṣḥāb from that tribal group are listed immediately below that.
    These tribal sections are tagged as subsections of the relevant ism section.
    The remaining part of al-sifr al-thānī consists of lists of transmitters,
    grouped by various parameters (tribes, women, disabilities, ...).
    Al-sifr al-thālith is organized mostly on a geographical/chronological basis.
    Only the parts on Mecca, Medina, Kūfa, N Iraq and Ifrīqiyā are (partly) extant.
    Annotator HRH's notes on al-sifr al-thānī:
    The structure of the book is very arbitrary. The
    author categorizes the names of the people who have quoted the words of
    the prophet in alphabetical order; but after naming someone from a
    specific tribe, he suddenly digresses to name other persons from that
    tribe and then returns to the alphabetical order. I categorized these
    digressions as sub-headers (mostly fourth-level header) and showed the
    return to the alphabetical order by a blank header tag (so that they are
    distinguishable). Moreover, the author names irrelevant names inside a
    category that is supposed to belong to one specific name (for example,
    the author mentions names like “أنسة”, “وإبراهيم”, … under the category
    entitled “من روى عن النبي اسمه: أوس” (in page 75-76)) . I also separated
    these names by a blank header so that they are distinguishable from the
    main category. Besides, sometimes the author names someone out of
    alphabetical order to add some explanation about him. I tagged such
    names with an asterisk (i.e. ### $ *). The last part of the text
    categorized some people according to brotherhood. I tagged these names
    with an asterisk too (see my note on “السفر الثالث” about this kind of
    names).
    Annotator HRH's notes on al-sifr al-thālith:
    ATTENTION: This book needs a review by a specialist
    in Hadith literature. It is very difficult for tagging since the
    structure is complex without enough and coherent titles. I try to
    explain all issues here: 1- From page PageV01P085 to PageV01P139 the
    text is categorized according to brotherhood and this relationship
    appears in one of three formats: “ولد مزاحم” or “محمد بن مزاحم، والضحاك
    بن مزاحم أخوان” or “محمد بن مزاحم أخو الضحاك بن مزاحم”. I tagged the
    first format as a header (since it is a title about a family) and the
    second and the third formats as biographical tag. But I tagged the names
    in the second format with an asterisk (i.e. ### $ *) to make it
    distinguishable from the other format (so that you can delete or change
    them if necessary, since this format includes more than one name
    anyway). Moreover, in other parts apart from the aforementioned part,
    sometimes the author names someone out of the category being discussed
    to add some explanation about him. I also tagged such names with an
    asterisk so that they are distinguishable from the other names. 2- From
    PageV01P158 to PageV01P181 and from PageV01P360 to PageV02P042, some
    titles are just related to one or a few paragraphs. This happens because
    most of the titles are interred into the text from the margin of the
    manuscript as the editor mentions. Although some events are separated by
    the title “وفي هذه السنة” (and I have tagged the text exactly according
    to the titles in the PDF), but I must warn that this title is not only
    vague, but also occasional and just appears in the beginning of some
    events (and not all of them). So, one solution could be deleting all the
    second-level tags (since they don’t encompass all the following
    paragraphs). There is a table of contents in Vol 4 which is descriptive
    (i.e. a description of the contents of paragraphs) and cannot be used
    for tagging the text; but, the other solution could be adding extra
    titles using this descriptive table of contents to make the structure of
    the book more accurate (And the last solution is to accept the text as
    it is and doing nothing!). The decision must be taken by a specialist in
    Hadith literature. 3- In PageV01P156 the text need a title: “اوّل من
    آمن:” (as written in the descriptive table of contents). 4- As written
    in page V02P109, a part is missing in the original manuscript. So, the
    rest of the text is not about the same person (i.e. “سعيد بن جبير”). I
    guess that it must be about “سعيد بن المسيب”. 5- In Vol 3, after naming
    an important person, the author names those he has quoted from and those
    who have quoted from him and then returns to the rest of the names of
    the main category and does the same thing for another important person.
    I showed the return to the main category by a blank header to make the
    next names distinguishable from the previous ones.
