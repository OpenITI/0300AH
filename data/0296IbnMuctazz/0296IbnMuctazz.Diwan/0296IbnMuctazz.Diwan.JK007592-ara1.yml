90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The book is a Diwan. So, it doesn’t need any tag.
    I just tagged the beginning of alphabetical letters. 2 - There is just
    one poem (page 481 in the PDF) that is not included in the Editpro text.
    I couldn’t find any other difference between the PDF and the text.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
