90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: MEHDI SHOJAIE, HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: NOTE OF THE ANNOTATOR (MEHDI SHOJAIE): The first volume accords to the version mentioned in
    meta header but volumes 2, 3, 4, 5 accords to the anothers version (http
    s://drive.google.com/file/d/1vhp9Nw77eUKWI3pFX0d2vDB0uMfGPOBr/view?usp=s
    haring), and volume 6 starts with page 255 (the first 255 pages of this
    volume existe in volume 5 of another version). Line 14803 number 53 is
    omitted. Line 47222 یوم الدین is wrong and یوم الفدین is correct. Line
    92822/ page 81 is not complete and page 82 and 83 are omitted. The names
    of chapters and the titles are messy but i tried to contens of book.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): 1- About the edition: The digital version is a combination of two different editions. The first five volumes are the Muʾssisaŧ al-Aʿlamī edition (first link which leads you to a payment-based website and you must have an account to see the PDF) and the rest of the volumes are Dar al-fikr edition (second link), beginning with PageV06P255 to avoid overlap with the first edition (NB: The first volumes of both editions are the same). 2- There is a table of the content at the right-side bar of the first link I provided. This table is very accurate and has a lot of titles that do not appear in the text. A specialist can use this table to add a lot of titles in square brackets to make the structure clearer. 3- About levelling of the headers: All the headers were first -levels. I corrected the levelling of the headers up to the tenth-level headers. In Ansab texts, presenting the correct levelling for headers is extremely difficult since you must find out the relations between people and tribes to do it. I tried to do this by searching in other sources and show it in the levelling of the headers. I added 6 titles in PageV12P019 and one title in PageV11P271 (in square brackets) to correct the levelling. Some changes are still needed in some parts by a specialist in Ansab literature. 4- Many of the redundant automatic tags were not removed, I removed a lot of them that I found. 5- The text was overtagged in names, usually by breaking the line and tagging the names inside the lines. I untagged such names, but replaced them with asterisk (i.e. # *) so that they can be used in a later stage for tagging the names inside the text (However, these name tags are not very consistent).
