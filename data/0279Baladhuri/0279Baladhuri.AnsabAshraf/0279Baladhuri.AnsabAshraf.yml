90#BOOK#COMMENT##:
    1- Shamela0009773 is a combination of two different editions.
    The first five volumes are the Muʾassasaŧ al-Aʿlamī edition and the rest of
    the volumes are the Dar al-fikr edition, beginning with PageV06P255 to avoid
    overlap with the first edition
    (NB: The first volumes of both editions are the same).
    2- Shia003425 is just the second volume of Muʾassasaŧ al-Aʿlamī edition.
