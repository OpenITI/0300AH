90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: There is a short part at the end of the book which
    does not exist in the original manuscript and the editor cannot confirm
    its authenticity; so it has been added as an appendix to the text (and I
    tagged it as an appendix).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
