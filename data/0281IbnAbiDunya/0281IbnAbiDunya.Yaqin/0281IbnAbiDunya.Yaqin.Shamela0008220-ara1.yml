90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The page numbers at the top of the pages are
    entered into the text. 2- From number 20 onwards, the numbers in the
    Editpro text are one less than those in the PDF; however, this is just a
    difference in pagination and the content is almost the same (I said
    “almost” because a few words are different in the whole of the Editpro
    text and that’s because I have used a different edition for collation
    (Editpro version was not found)).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
