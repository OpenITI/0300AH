90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The page numbers at the top of the pages are entered into the text. 2- From number 20 onwards, the numbers in the Editpro text are one less than those in the PDF; however, this is just a difference in pagination and the content is almost the same (I said “almost” because a few words are different in the whole of the Editpro text and that’s because I have used a different edition for collation (Editpro version was not found)).
