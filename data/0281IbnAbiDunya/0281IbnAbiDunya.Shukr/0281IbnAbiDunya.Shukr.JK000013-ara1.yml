90#VERS#COMMENT##: The Editpro edition was not found. I used the third
    volume of “موسوعة ابن أبي الدنيا”; nevertheless, the difference between
    the two editions is not more than a few words. In any case, this short
    treatise has no title and nothing else that need to be tagged
    (structurally).
    All paratextual elements
