90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The page numbers at the top of the pages are
    entered into the text. 2- There is a note of the scribe at the beginning
    of the text. I tagged it as EDITORIAL (since it is not written by the
    original author) (and the first page of this editorial section is
    missing).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
