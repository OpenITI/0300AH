90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The page numbers at the top of the pages are
            entered into the text. 2- There is a note of the scribe at the beginning
            of the text. I tagged it as EDITORIAL (since it is not written by the
            original author) (and the first page of this editorial section is
            missing).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
