90#VERS#COMMENT##: The information regarding the editor and the
    publisher of the book at the #META section is wrong. The correct
    information appears at the beginning of the Editorial Section. 2- Very
    small discrepancies between the text and the PDF: Number 17 (in page 19)
    is missing and number 29 appears instead of 69 in page 29.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
