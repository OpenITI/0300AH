90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The page numbers at the top of the pages are
    entered into the text. 2- Many of the numbers of Hadiths were wrong and
    I corrected them because such texts are useless without the numbers (and
    I never change anything else inside the text; I just corrected the
    numbers). SPL: the worldcat links are to a different edition (pub. 1996 not 1998), but it seems preferable to include the links.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
