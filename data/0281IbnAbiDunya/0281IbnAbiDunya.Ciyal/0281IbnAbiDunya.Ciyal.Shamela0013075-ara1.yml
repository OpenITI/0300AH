90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The JK version was better for annotating, yet I
            didn’t work on that because in most pages, a great amount of the
            footnotes were interred into the text and this made the text unusable.
            2- There were very small discrepancies between the text and the PDF:
            number 423 (page 605), number 443 (page 627) and number 636 (page 839)
            are missing in the text.
            NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 1407
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
