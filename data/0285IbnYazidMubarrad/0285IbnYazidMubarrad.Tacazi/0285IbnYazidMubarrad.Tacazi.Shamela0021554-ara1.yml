90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- A part of pages 142-146 is missing (both in PDF
    and in Editpro text). 2- Some of the titles that are in brackets in the
    PDF are missing in the text. I just added a blank header in their
    places.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
