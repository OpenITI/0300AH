90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Gowaart: footnote markers, editorial sections and redundant
    headers have been deleted, poetry has been formatted. I have not addressed the
    pagination issue, as HRH did not provide specifics as to where to locate these.
    HRH: 1- There are some redundant page numbers at wrong
    places. 2- Some titles are repeated redundantly (for example, the title
    in PageV02P211). 3- Some titles don’t appear in the Table of Contents
    (for example, the title in PageV03P100). 4- A missing title in
    PageV01P257.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 7512
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 1349, 3799, 8269,
    15921
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
