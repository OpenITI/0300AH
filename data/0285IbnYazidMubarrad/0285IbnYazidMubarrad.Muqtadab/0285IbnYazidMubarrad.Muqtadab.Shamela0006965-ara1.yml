90#VERS#COMMENT##: Validation: the digital text does not have proper paragraph
            markers. I have tagged the poetry and deleted most of the "random characters".
            The Pagination issue for volume 1 remains, it needs to be addressed perhaps by a
            script which repaginates PageV01P003 to PageV01P271 as PageV01P141 to
            PageV01P407. I have not reconsidered HRH's hierarchy of titles, it seems
            sensible and would have to be addressed by an expert.
                1- The edition I found seems to be a reprint of the
            edition used in Editpro text (by the same editor but different
            publisher). The only difference is that in Vol 1 of the PDFs, the
            pagination does not begin from 1, but from 141 (after the introduction);
            however, the pages are exactly the same in all volumes. 2- The book’s
            table of contents does not have any categorization for titles;
            nevertheless, some titles are obviously subtitles of some others. I
            categorized the text as long as possible; however, the titles are very
            tricky and so similar to each other that I can’t decide whether this
            title is a subcategory of that one or not. So, the level of
            categorization for the titles is probably not correct in some cases.
            Accurate categorization needs thorough reading of the text by a
            specialist in Arabic grammar.
            NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 1133, 1272,
            1299, 1617, 2211, 3620, 4104, 4105, 4279, 4295, 4300, 4473, 5323, 5927, 6078,
            6858, 6872, 7117, 7434, 7701, 8125, 8707, 9538, 9897, 10128, 10173, 10657,
            10795, 10974, 11050, 11052, 11690, 12688, 12692, 12750, 13165, 13420, 13588,
