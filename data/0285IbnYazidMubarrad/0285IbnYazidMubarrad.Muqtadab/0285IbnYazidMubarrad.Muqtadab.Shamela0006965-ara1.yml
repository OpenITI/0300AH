90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The edition I found seems to be a reprint of the edition used in Editpro text (by the same editor but different publisher). The only difference is that in Vol 1 of the PDFs, the pagination does not begin from 1, but from 141 (after the introduction); however, the pages are exactly the same in all volumes. 2- The book’s table of contents does not have any categorization for titles; nevertheless, some titles are obviously subtitles of some others. I categorized the text as long as possible; however, the titles are very tricky and so similar to each other that I can’t decide whether this title is a subcategory of that one or not. So, the level of categorization for the titles is probably not correct in some cases. Accurate categorization needs thorough reading of the text by a specialist in Arabic grammar.
