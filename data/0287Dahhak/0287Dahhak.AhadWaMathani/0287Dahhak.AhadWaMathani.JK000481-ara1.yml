90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- “ومما أسند”, which is a subtitle, is missing in most places (and I placed a blank header in its place). 2- A part of some of the names is missing. This happens just when two titles appear successively without any space (see for example PageV02P314 name NO. 260 which is “المزني” instead of “نعمان المزني” and is appeared after a second-level title). 3- About categorizing the titles: 3.1) The book does not have any table of contents and most of the headers are names of tribes; so, understanding the correct categorization of these tribes are very difficult. I tried to find the relations between the persons by searching their names in other sources and present a correct categorization as long as it was possible. For example, in the first volume, the complete name of “مطعم بن عدي” (in PageV01P359) is “مطعم بن عدی بن نوفل بن عبد مناف” and therefore his category is a subcategory of “ومن بني نوفل بن عبد مناف”, but the next category “بني أمية بن عبد شمس بن عبد مناف” is not a subcategory of this category (i.e. “مطعم بن عدی بن نوفل بن عبد مناف”) since “عبد شمس” and “نوفل” are brothers and there isn’t a major category which encompasses both these categories; so, they should be tagged just as parallel categories, and this is true about many other categories. For example, from PageV01P411 to PageV02P123, all categories are the family of “لؤي بن غالب بن فهر”; nevertheless, none of them is a subcategory of the other, but they are all parallel categories, without any macro category. The same is true about PageV02P164 to PageV02P282 in which all categories are members of the family of “عبد مناف بن كنانة” and also about PageV02P283 to PageV02P439 in which all categories are members of the family of “إلياس بن مضر”, again without any macro category. 3.2) It seems that from PageV04P256 under the title “ومن ذكر اليمن ورجالهم” to PageV05P337, all the tribes are from Yemen. If so, they all should be tagged as subcategories of this category. I searched about all the tribes, but I couldn’t make sure whether all of them were settled in this place or not (this needs the confirmation of an expert).
