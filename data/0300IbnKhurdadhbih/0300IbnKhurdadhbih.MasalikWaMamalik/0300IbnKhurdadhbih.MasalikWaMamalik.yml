90#BOOK#COMMENT##: One of the earliest extant geographical texts.
    The basic structure of the text is quite simple: after a short introduction,
    the author divides his work into 5 main chapters: 
    a chapter on the Sawād / al-ʿIrāq, the centre of the Sasanian empire,
    followed by a chapter each on (the current situation in)
    the four quarters of the Sasanian empire: al-Mashriq, al-Maghrib,
    al-Jarbī (North) and al-Tayammun (South).
    These are followed by a shorter chapter that contains various information
    that did not fit easily in the previous chapters. 
    Within the chapters, the structure is more complex.
    The first chapter, on the Sawād, contains a list of its geographical 
    units and the tax income derived from them.
    The next four chapters are organized along routes from al-ʿIrāq
    to the furthest parts of each quarter; once a route reaches a new 
    region, its geographical units and tax income are listed,
    sometimes along with other topics of interest.
