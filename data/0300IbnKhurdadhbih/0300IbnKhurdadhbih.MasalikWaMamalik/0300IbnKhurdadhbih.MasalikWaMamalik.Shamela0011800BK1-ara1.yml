90#VERS#COMMENT##: The Dār Ṣādir edition this text file is based on
    is a photographic reproduction of the classic De Goeje edition
    (volume 6 in his Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum),
    which contains two texts:
    - Ibn Khurdādhbih's al-Masālik wa-al-mamālik
    - selections from Qudāma's Kitāb al-Kharāj, related to geography.
    PV split the text file and tagged the structure of Ibn Khurdādhbih's book.
    The basic structure of the text is quite simple: after a short introduction,
    the author divides his work into 5 main chapters:
    a chapter on the Sawād / al-ʿIrāq, the centre of the Sasanian empire,
    followed by a chapter each on (the current situation in)
    the four quarters of the Sasanian empire: al-Mashriq, al-Maghrib,
    al-Jarbī (North) and al-Tayammun (South).
    These are followed by a shorter chapter that contains various information
    that did not fit easily in the previous chapters.
    Within the chapters, the structure is more complex.
    The first chapter, on the Sawād, contains a list of its geographical
    units and the tax income derived from them.
    The next four chapters are organized along routes from al-ʿIrāq
    to the furthest parts of each quarter; once a route reaches a new
    region, its geographical units and tax income are listed,
    sometimes along with other topics of interest.
    PV has tagged subsections within these chapters; some of these
    are given headings by the author himself, for others PV added headings
    between square brackets.
    Much of the work consists of itineraries and lists of places;
    PV has put each item in a list and each stage in an itinerary
    on a new line and tagged it with a hashtag;
    digressions about an item are tagged with two tildes.
    The digital text contained quite a number of typos, related to the quaint font
    used in these Brill publications; PV corrected recurrent typos
    (e.g., البحر was almost consistently mistranscribed الجر).
    De Goeje sometimes uses undotted letters when he is not sure about a reading;
    these had been replaced with a question mark in the digital text,
    PV restored the undotted letters.
